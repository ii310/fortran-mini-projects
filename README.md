# Fortran Projects 

This repository documents my journey of learning Fortran, starting from scratch and building upon further exploration. 
I chose to document my projects and progress here to not only keep a record but also to share my learning process with others who might be on a similar journey.

## Why Fortran?

Driven by a profound interest in physics and Simulating Motions, I embarked on a journey to explore the languages that power real scientific and aerospace systems. 
Despite its age, Fortran remains a fast language, widely used in simulations, numerical methods, and legacy code, making it a fascinating and practical choice for my learning journey.

## Learning Road Map

I'm following the book:  
**"Fortran for Scientists and Engineers" by Shepten & Chapman**
Also researching on the internet as well. 

I’m progressing chapter by chapter, going from:
- [ ] Chapter 1 – 3: Basics — variables, PRINT, READ, syntax
- [ ] Chapter 4 – 5: Control flow, loops, arrays
- [ ] Later: Functions, modules, file I/O, scientific libraries

## How to Run the Code

### 1. Install a Fortran compiler (e.g.,`gfortran`)
```bash
sudo apt install gfortran      # Linux
brew install gcc               # macOS
```
