# Fortran Projects â€” Fundamentals, Experiments, and Beyond ~

This repository documents my journey of learning Fortran, starting from scratch and building upon further exploration. 
I chose to document my projects and progress here to not only keep a record for myself but also to share my learning process with others who might be on a similar journey.

## Why Fortran?

Driven by a profound interest in physics and Simulating Motions, I embarked on a journey to explore the languages that power real scientific and aerospace systems. 
Despite its age, Fortran remains a fast language, widely used in simulations, numerical methods, and legacy code, making it a fascinating and practical choice for my learning journey.

## Learning Road Map

I'm following the book: Â 
**"Fortran for Scientists and Engineers" by Shepten & Chapman**
As well as researching on the internet to see what people have implementedÂ 

Iâ€™m progressing chapter by chapter, going from:
- [ ] Chapter 1 â€“ 3: Basics â€” variables, PRINT, READ, syntax
- [ ] Chapter 4 â€“ 5: Control flow, loops, arrays
- [ ] Later: Functions, modules, file I/O, scientific libraries

## Progress Log
I Invite you to explore my detailed progress log in [`progress.md`](./docs/PROGRESS.md). 
This log not only tracks my key learning milestones but also shares my insights and learnings from each project, including syntax quirks and compiler behaviors.

### ðŸ”– Learning Level Tags

Each milestone in `progress.md` is labeled with a difficulty level:

- ðŸŸ¢ Basic â€” syntax, variables, input/output
- ðŸ”µ Intermediate â€” control flow, arrays, functions
- ðŸ”´ Advanced â€” modules, file I/O, numerical methods, simulations

## How to Run the Code

### 1. Install a Fortran compiler (e.g.,`gfortran`)
```bash
sudo apt install gfortranÂ  Â  Â  # Linux
brew install gccÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â # macOS
```
