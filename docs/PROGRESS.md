### 2025-07-06 – Milestone 0: First Build & Run

* Set up repository structure, pushed to github
* Added `01_hello_world` project with Makefile
* (basic PRINT demo just for test)

**Key Takeaway**
- Fortran’s program/unit structure is stricter than C/Python: every source needs an explicit `PROGRAM … END PROGRAM` wrapper. 
- Compiler rejected the file until the wrapper matched by good named reminder to respect case insensitive but sensitive name conventions.
